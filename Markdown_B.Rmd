## PART 2

2. Write a program in R to simulate the preferential attachment process, starting with 4 pages linked together as a directed cycle on 4 vertices, adding pages each with one outlink until there are 1 million pages, and using $\gamma$ = 0.5 as the probability a link is to a page chosen uniformly at random and 1 âˆ’ $\gamma$  = 0.5 as the probability a link is copied from existing links.

```{r include=TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# libraries used:
library(igraph)
library(mc2d)
library(sdpt3r)
library(glue)
library(ggplot2)
library(gridExtra)
library(gt)
library(knitr)
```

```{r include=FALSE}
set.seed(1765820)
```

In order to generate a graph it has been decided to represent it has list of edges. Our implementation uses two vectors in order to speed up the process even further.

```{r include=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
rep.row<-function(x,n){
  matrix(rep(x,each=n),nrow=n)
} # the function is used to pre-allocate the matrix of all the edges

# the "graph_generator" generates the graph
graph_generator <- function(Num_nodes, gamma=.5){
  
  E_one=1:Num_nodes
  E_two=rep(0,Num_nodes) 
  # we found out that using 2 vectors instead of a matrix with 2 columns gives a      minor 
  # boost in the computation speed.
  E_two[1] <-2 
  E_two[2] <-3
  E_two[3] <-4
  E_two[4] <-1
  
  
  for (new_vertex in 5:Num_nodes){
    if (rbern(n = 1, prob=gamma) ==1) {
      get_vertex = sample(E_one[1:(new_vertex-1)], 1) 
      # choosing existing node uniformly    
      E_two[new_vertex] <-get_vertex
    }
    else {
      get_vertex = sample(E_two[1:(new_vertex-1)], 1) 
      # choosing existing node with a weighted distribution (based on the in-degree)
      E_two[new_vertex] <-get_vertex
    }
  }
  results = list()
  results$one = E_one
  results$two = E_two
  return(results)
} 
```

The "cumulative_empirical" function computes the empirical degree distribution and cumulative degree distribution. It has been decided to work with a matrix becouse in this way we can return the 3 results in 1 object; more specifically: 
- in degree value,
- empirical degree distribution,
- cumulative degree distribution.

```{r include=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
cumulative_empirical = function(E){
  
  E_one = E$one # staring node vector 
  E_two = E$two # ending node vector
  Num_nodes = length(E$one)
  
  # we iterate through all the numbers in the E_two (which is the vector containing   # the end-nodes of
  # the edges) and add one to the corresponding element in vector in_nodes
  # (which is the vector containing the in-degree of the nodes).  
  # For example: 
  # if E_two = [2 3 4 1 2 2 5 2 3 5 5 5], we first add 1 to the second element of 
  # the in_nodes vector, then to the third, then to the fourth, then first, second,
  # second, fifth, etc...
  # At the end, the in_nodes vector will be: [1 4 2 1 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0] meaning that
  # the in-degree of node 1 is 1, the in-degree of node 2 is 4, etc...

  in_nodes=rep(0,Num_nodes) # pre-allocate a vector with 0
  for (i in 1:Num_nodes){
    in_nodes[E_two[i]]=in_nodes[E_two[i]]+1
  }
  
  sorted_in_nodes=sort(in_nodes,decreasing=TRUE)
  indexes=unique(sorted_in_nodes) # it's the number of nodes where the cumulative     changes
  
  A=rep.row(c(0,0,0),length(indexes)) 
  # pre-allocate the matrix. In the first column there are the values representing
  # the node where there is at least awhere there is 
  # 
  
  A[,1]=indexes
  
  counter_cumulative = 0
  counter_empirical = 0
  j=1
  for (i in 1:length(indexes)){
    in_degree_value=A[i,1]
    counter_empirical = 0 # here we reset the counter every time we change in-degree node
    # because it is used to compute the empirical distribution.
    while(j<=Num_nodes && sorted_in_nodes[j]==in_degree_value){
      
      # we calculate the empirical distribution with a single
      # loop trough the vector: we use the fact that vector is already sorted,
      # so it is not necessary to look all the elements once we find the 
      # first one which is different from the current in-degree value.
      counter_empirical = counter_empirical +1
      j=j+1
    } 
    
    counter_cumulative = counter_cumulative + counter_empirical
    A[i,3]=counter_cumulative
    A[i,2]=counter_empirical
  }
  
  empirical = rev(A[,2])[-1]
  cumulative = rev(A[,3])[-1]
  in_degree_value = rev(A[,1])[-1]
  return(A)

}
```

The code below generates 5 graphs with 1 million edges, and store each of them inside a network_{i}.csv file.
```{r include=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
for (i in 1:5){
  A = cumulative_empirical(graph_generator(1000000))
  write.csv(A, glue("networks_final/network_{i}.csv"), row.names = F)
  print(glue('graph {i} stored'))
}

```


2. Does the degree distribution appear to follow a power law or a Poisson? Explain and comment by showing suitable visual and numerical evidence that supports your reasoning.



```{r include=TRUE, eval=TRUE}

D1 = as.data.frame(read.csv("distributions_matrices/cum_dev_matrix_1.csv"))
D2 = as.data.frame(read.csv("distributions_matrices/cum_dev_matrix_2.csv"))
D3 = as.data.frame(read.csv("distributions_matrices/cum_dev_matrix_3.csv"))
D4 = as.data.frame(read.csv("distributions_matrices/cum_dev_matrix_4.csv"))
D5 = as.data.frame(read.csv("distributions_matrices/cum_dev_matrix_5.csv"))

```

As a preliminary analysis we simply try to see how close our distributions are to a power law visually. For that reason we simply plotted the regression lines on the distributions and see how close they are to a straight line.

WARNING: Be careful, the following coefficients and the intercepts are shown only to give an idea of the slope of the regression lines, and are not to be taken as a serious statistical test.

By digging into the igraph library we found a function called fit_power_law(), that fits the empirical data with a power law distribution and then computes the goodness of the fit with the Kolmogorovâ€“Smirnov test. This should return a more robust statistical result. The function returns the KS_stat and the p-value. The KS_stat tells us how well the power law distribution fits our data, i.e to a lower value better corresponds a better fit. However, this measure alone is not enough to tell how likely it is that data is drawn from a power law. For that reason the function also returns the p-value. This is a two-sided test, with a confidence interval $\alpha$ that has to be chosen when running the test, usually the used values are 1%, 3%, 5%. In this case it is irrelevant which value of $\alpha$ one chooses because the returned p-value is very close to one (when rounded to two decimals, as in the table below, it is exactly 1). If the p-value is above the critical value (p-value > $\alpha$) then, we accept the $H_{0}$ otherwise we reject $H_{0}$.
Below is reported a summary table with the KS_statistics and the p-value:

```{r echo = FALSE, results = 'asis', include=TRUE}

ks_stat <- rep(0, 5)
p_value <- rep(0, 5)
m = 1
for (df in df_list){
  
  results <- fit_power_law(df$V2, xmin=1)
  ks_stat[m] <- round(results$KS.stat,2)
  p_value[m] <- round(results$KS.p,2)
  m = m+1
}

ks_df <- data.frame(cbind(graph_names, ks_stat, p_value))
kable(ks_df, caption= "Kolmogorov-Smirnov Goodness of Fit Test")
```


As a comparison, this is the result of a KS test on a graph generated with $\gamma$ = 1 

```{r}

#graph_gamma = graph_generator(1000, 1)


```
