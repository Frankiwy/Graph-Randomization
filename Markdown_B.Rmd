## PART 2

### 2.1 Write a program in R to simulate the preferential attachment process, starting with 4 pages linked together as a directed cycle on 4 vertices, adding pages each with one outlink until there are 1 million pages, and using $\gamma$ = 0.5 as the probability a link is to a page chosen uniformly at random and 1 − $\gamma$  = 0.5 as the probability a link is copied from existing links.

```{r include=TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# libraries used:
library(igraph)
library(mc2d)
library(sdpt3r)
library(glue)
library(ggplot2)
library(gridExtra)
library(gt)
library(knitr)
```

```{r include=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
set.seed(1765820)
dir.create("graphs_matrices")
dir.create("distributions_matrices")
```

In order to generate a graph it has been decided to represent it has list of edges. Our implementation uses two vectors in order to speed up the process even further.

```{r include=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
rep.row<-function(x,n){
  matrix(rep(x,each=n),nrow=n)
} # the function is used to pre-allocate the matrix of all the edges

# the "graph_generator" generates the graph
graph_generator <- function(Num_nodes, gamma=.5){
  
  E_one=1:Num_nodes
  E_two=rep(0,Num_nodes) 
  # we found out that using 2 vectors instead of a matrix with 2 columns gives a      minor 
  # boost in the computation speed.
  E_two[1] <-2 
  E_two[2] <-3
  E_two[3] <-4
  E_two[4] <-1
  
  
  for (new_vertex in 5:Num_nodes){
    if (rbern(n = 1, prob=gamma) ==1) {
      get_vertex = sample(E_one[1:(new_vertex-1)], 1) 
      # choosing existing node uniformly    
      E_two[new_vertex] <-get_vertex
    }
    else {
      get_vertex = sample(E_two[1:(new_vertex-1)], 1) 
      # choosing existing node with a weighted distribution (based on the in-degree)
      E_two[new_vertex] <-get_vertex
    }
  }
  results = list()
  results$one = E_one
  results$two = E_two
  return(results)
} 
```

The "cumulative_empirical" function computes the empirical degree distribution and cumulative degree distribution. It has been decided to work with a matrix becouse in this way we can return the 3 results in 1 object; more specifically: 
* in degree value,
* empirical degree distribution,
* cumulative degree distribution.

```{r include=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
cumulative_empirical = function(E){
  
  E_one = E$one # staring node vector 
  E_two = E$two # ending node vector
  Num_nodes = length(E$one)
  
  # we iterate through all the numbers in the E_two (which is the vector containing   # the end-nodes of the edges) and add one to the corresponding element in vector    #in_nodes (which is the vector containing the in-degree of the nodes).  
  # For example: 
  # if E_two = [2 3 4 1 2 2 5 2 3 5 5 5], we first add 1 to the second element of 
  # the in_nodes vector, then to the third, then to the fourth, then fifth, etc...
  # At the end, the in_nodes vector will be: [1 4 2 1 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0] meaning that
  # the in-degree of node 1 is 1, the in-degree of node 2 is 4, etc...

  in_nodes=rep(0,Num_nodes) # pre-allocate a vector with 0
  for (i in 1:Num_nodes){
    in_nodes[E_two[i]]=in_nodes[E_two[i]]+1
  }
  
  sorted_in_nodes=sort(in_nodes,decreasing=TRUE)
  indexes=unique(sorted_in_nodes) # it's the number of nodes where the cumulative     changes
  
  A=rep.row(c(0,0,0),length(indexes)) 
  # pre-allocate the matrix. In the first column there are the values where there is
  # at least one node with that in-degree 
  
  A[,1]=indexes
  
  counter_cumulative = 0
  counter_empirical = 0
  j=1
  for (i in 1:length(indexes)){
    in_degree_value=A[i,1]
    counter_empirical = 0 # here we reset the counter every time we change in-degree node because it is used to compute the empirical distribution.
    while(j<=Num_nodes && sorted_in_nodes[j]==in_degree_value){
      
      # we calculate the empirical distribution with a single
      # loop trough the vector: we use the fact that vector is already sorted,
      # so it is not necessary to look at all the elements once we find the 
      # first one which is different from the current in-degree value.
      counter_empirical = counter_empirical +1
      j=j+1
    } 
    
    counter_cumulative = counter_cumulative + counter_empirical
    A[i,3]=counter_cumulative
    A[i,2]=counter_empirical
  }
  
  empirical = rev(A[,2])[-1]
  cumulative = rev(A[,3])[-1]
  in_degree_value = rev(A[,1])[-1]
  return(A)

}
```

The code below generates 5 graphs with 1 million edges, and stores each of them inside a graph_{i}.csv file. Moreover, also a matrix containing the empirical and cumulative distribution for each graph is stored into a .csv file.
```{r include=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
for (i in 1:5){
  gen_graph = graph_generator(1000000)
  write.csv(gen_graph, glue("graphs_matrices/graph_{i}.csv"), row.names = F)
  A = cumulative_empirical(gen_graph)
  write.csv(A, glue("distributions_matrices/cum_dev_matrix_{i}.csv"), row.names = F)
  print(glue('graph {i} stored'))
}
```


### 2.2 Does the degree distribution appear to follow a power law or a Poisson? Explain and comment by showing suitable visual and numerical evidence that supports your reasoning.


```{r include=TRUE, eval=TRUE}

# here we import the cum_dev matrices (computed and stored before) for all the graphs.
D1 = as.data.frame(read.csv("distributions_matrices/cum_dev_matrix_1.csv"))
D2 = as.data.frame(read.csv("distributions_matrices/cum_dev_matrix_2.csv"))
D3 = as.data.frame(read.csv("distributions_matrices/cum_dev_matrix_3.csv"))
D4 = as.data.frame(read.csv("distributions_matrices/cum_dev_matrix_4.csv"))
D5 = as.data.frame(read.csv("distributions_matrices/cum_dev_matrix_5.csv"))

```

Below are reported two plots showing respectively empirical and cumulative degree distributions for all the 5 generated graphs.

```

As a preliminary analysis we simply try to see how close our distributions are to a power law visually. For that reason we plotted the regression lines on the distributions and see how close they are to a straight line.

By digging into the igraph library we found a function called fit_power_law(), that fits the empirical data with a power law distribution and then computes the goodness of the fit with the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. This should return a more robust statistical result. The function returns the KS_stat and the p-value. The KS_stat tells us how well the power law distribution fits our data, i.e to a lower value better corresponds a better fit. However, this measure alone is not enough to tell how likely it is that data is drawn from a power law. For that reason the function also returns the p-value. One has to choose a confidence interval $\alpha$ while running the test, usually the used values are 1%, 3%, 5%. Getting a value higher then the chosen $\alpha$ means that the fit is "good" and the higher the value is better the fit (sometimes we even get 1 when we rounded to two decimal places). 

P.S.
We are both looking forward to learning more about these kind of tests during the rest of the course.
Below it is reported a summary table with the KS_statistics and the p-value:

```{r echo = FALSE, results = 'asis', include=TRUE}
# Compute KS-test:

ks_stat <- rep(0, 5)
p_value <- rep(0, 5)
m = 1
for (df in df_list){
  
  results <- fit_power_law(df$V2, xmin=1) #compute KS-Test
  ks_stat[m] <- round(results$KS.stat,4) # get KS-stat
  p_value[m] <- round(results$KS.p,4) #get p-value
  m = m+1
}

ks_df <- data.frame(cbind(graph_names, ks_stat, p_value))
kable(ks_df, caption= "Kolmogorov-Smirnov Goodness of Fit Test")
```

As a comparison, below is returned the result of a KS test on a graph generated with $\gamma$ = 1 (this means that every new link is added uniformly at random to already existing node).   

```{r, eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
graph_gamma = graph_generator(200000, 1) 
cm_em_gamma = cumulative_empirical(graph_gamma)

write.csv(graph_gamma, "graphs_matrices/graph_gamma.csv", row.names = F)
write.csv(cm_em_gamma, glue("distributions_matrices/cm_em_gamma.csv"), row.names = F)
```

```{r, eval=TRUE, include=FALSE}
cm_em_gamma = as.data.frame(read.csv("distributions_matrices/cm_em_gamma.csv"))
```

```{r, eval=TRUE, include=TRUE}
cm_em_gamma = as.data.frame(read.csv("distributions_matrices/cm_em_gamma.csv"))
print(glue("p-value: {round(fit_power_law(cm_em_gamma[,2], xmin=1)$KS.p,4)}"))
```


It is clear from the following plot, and supported by the p-value from the KS-test, that the generated graph does not follow a power law distribution:  

```{r, eval=TRUE, include=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

p_gamma <- ggplot(cm_em_gamma, aes(x=log(V1), y=log(V3))) +
  geom_point(size=1, color="#0294A5")+
  geom_smooth(method=lm, se=FALSE, linetype="dashed", color="#C1403D")+ 
  ggtitle(expression(paste("Cumulative & fitting line for ",gamma," =1"))) +
  xlab("K in log scale") + ylab("Cumulative in log scale") +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(color="#0294A5", size=25, face="bold.italic"),
    axis.title.x = element_text(color="black", size=10, face="bold"),
    axis.title.y = element_text(color="black", size=10, face="bold")
  )
p_gamma
```


The visualization of a huge graph is always a big issue, for that reason it has been decided to plot only the edges of two graphs, one generated using $\gamma$=.5 and the other one with $\gamma$= 1, both having 100000 nodes/edges. 

**We have also plotted two graphs, with the same generating processes, but with 1.000.000 edges.** To see the details, they required to be saved with a very high resolution that does not fit with the R markdown. For that reason we haven't included them into the markdown but **can be found inside the images folder under the names "power_law.png" and "not_power_law.png".** Of course, in  order to see the details it is necessary to **_zoom deeply_** into every picture.

As it is possible to see from the figure below, there is a significant difference between the two graphs:

* **graph B:** the edges in the graph that follows a power law distribution has a small number of very high degree nodes and the edges are concentrated around a small number of very high degree nodes.

* **graph A:** in the graph on the left this is not the same, in fact it is not possible to distinguish a high concentration of edges around few nodes.
